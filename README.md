# 🌍 Natural Disaster Prediction System

Welcome to the **Natural Disaster Prediction System** repository! This project focuses on leveraging AI and machine learning to predict natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. Our goal is to optimize resource allocation, enhance disaster preparedness, and provide actionable insights to emergency responders and affected communities.

## 🚀 Features
- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast natural disasters.
- **Real-Time Data Analysis:** Processes real-time data from various sources for accurate predictions.
- **Resource Optimization:** Helps in allocating resources effectively to minimize damage.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for emergency responders and decision-makers.

## 📊 Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language for data processing and model building.
TensorFlow/PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks for building predictive models.
Docker: Containerization for easy deployment.
SQL: Database management for storing and retrieving data.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend development of the web interface.

## 🔧 Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/natural-disaster-prediction.git
cd natural-disaster-prediction

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the web application:
cd web_app
python app.py

## 🌟 How to Use
1. Upload Data: Provide historical data or real-time data feeds for prediction.
2. Run Predictions: Execute the predictive model to forecast upcoming natural disasters.
3. View Results: Analyze predictions through visualizations and reports.
