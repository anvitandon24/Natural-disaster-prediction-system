# 🌍 Natural Disaster Prediction System

Welcome to the **Natural Disaster Prediction System** repository! This project focuses on leveraging AI and machine learning to predict natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. Our goal is to optimize resource allocation, enhance disaster preparedness, and provide actionable insights to emergency responders and affected communities.

## 🚀 Features
- **Predictive Modeling:** Uses advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast natural disasters.
- **Real-Time Data Analysis:** Processes real-time data from various sources for accurate predictions.
- **Resource Optimization:** Helps in allocating resources effectively to minimize damage.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for emergency responders and decision-makers.
